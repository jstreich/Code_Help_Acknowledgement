##### Acknowledgement of coding help
Like almost every human ever, I learned coding from others and my skills are 
a reflection of those I’ve worked with, human, or computer.



##### Help From Other Humans, aka co-workers
We all get help from time to time, plus we sometimes reuse old code, even code 
others helped us create. I try to put names of people who helped write code. 
Sometimes I recycle code many times and the orginal assistant name gets lost 
on consecutive code recyclings.



##### Help From Online Tutorials or Error Finding Pages, stackoverflow, blogs, etc.
I love to learn new skills and that sometimes means I used someone’s tutorial 
to answer a problem. I usually try to put a link to the page in my code. 
Likewise if someone writes a snippit of code that I use, I’ll try to put that 
in the citation at the bottom of my scripts and programs.



##### Help From ChatGPT
This is an amazing tool and I learn from it everyday. I can ask it to make 
several different versions of the same program and learn new skills through it. 
It often requires significant editing to get the actual behavior that I want. 
If a program or script took substantial editing, then I’ll claim I wrote most 
of it. If a script or program requires zero to little editing then I’ll post 
it was from ChatGPT. I’ve asked it to recreate solutions to problems I’ve 
already solved and at times it gives near the exact same solution, only it 
types much much faster. Thus, I like to use it to draft scripts and programs 
in minutes that require (miniutes, hours, maybe 1-2 days) debugging, rather 
than writing code from scratch. This is not always true, some work requires 
intense forethough to get proper results rather than “any” results, which 
ChatGPT is known for. 


##### Final Statement
I’ll always make sure any program I write, cowrite, or have AI assistance with, 
actually returns meaningfful solutions through experience and practice I’ve 
gained in my years working in data analysis and programming.
